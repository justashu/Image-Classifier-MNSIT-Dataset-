# Image-Classifier-MNSIT-Dataset-
- Built a deep learning model from scratch, used the mathematical equations to implement algorithms in the model 
- Applied the backward and forward propagation to classify the fashion MNIST image data (10,000 images - 28*28) 
- Normalised and preprocessed the data and, after hyperparameter tuning, obtained an accuracy of 90% on the test cases 
- Applied Multiclass Classifcation on the same data using Logistic Regression and obtained an accuracy of 86.67%
